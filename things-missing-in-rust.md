- REPL
- Default function arguments
- HashMap literal macros (hashmap!{}, btreemap!{} etc) -> maplit create should be part of rust
- test reporters
- test.serial?
- test afterEach
- npm scripts functionality(dynamically retrieve version and write it to code during compile time)_
- cargo test needs better filtering for unit tests, example: cargo test src/utils/recursive_file_lookup.rs
- better test diffs
- only very primitive types allowed as const during compile type (json const not allowed for example)
- recursive copy in standard library


CHECK:
